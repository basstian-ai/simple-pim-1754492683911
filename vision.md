# PIM Product Vision

## Purpose

Build a modern, vendor-neutral Product Information Management (PIM) platform that helps teams create, govern, and distribute high-quality product data across channels—fast, safely, and with confidence.

## Who it’s for

* **Merchandisers & Product Owners** – curate catalog, enrich content, ensure readiness.
* **Localizers/Translators** – manage multi-locale content efficiently.
* **E-commerce/Channel Managers** – map attributes to channels and publish reliably.
* **Engineers** – integrate data in/out with clear contracts and observability.

## Core value propositions

1. **Dashboards & Insights (first-class)**

   * Operations overview (backlog, blockers, SLA health).
   * Data quality heatmaps, rule leaderboards, trending issues.
   * Publish pipeline health (per channel), failure drill-downs.
   * Translation workload & aging views.
2. **Unified product workspace**

   * Powerful search, filters, and saved, shareable views.
   * Variant matrix editing (e.g., size/color) with bulk actions and undo.
   * Side-by-side localization with glossary checks.
3. **Data quality & governance**

   * Rule builder for completeness/consistency (channel & locale aware).
   * Inline validation with explainers and quick-fix flows.
4. **Publishing & channel management**

   * Visual mapping from PIM attributes → channel payloads.
   * Transform snippets with dry-run JSON preview.
   * Reliable, observable export jobs with retries and alerts.
5. **Collaboration & workflow**

   * Assignments, comments, review/approve gates.
   * Audit trail and activity timeline at entity level.
6. **Extensibility**

   * Modular import/export adapters.
   * Webhook/API contracts for integrations.
   * Pluggable rules/transformers.

## Front-end & UX principles

* **Clarity over cleverness** – consistent layout, obvious affordances, clear empty states.
* **Speed is a feature** – snappy interactions, optimistic UI, granular loading, virtualized grids.
* **Keyboard-first** – command palette, shortcuts for common actions, focus management.
* **Accessible by default** – WCAG 2.1 AA (labels, contrast, roles, focus order, ARIA).
* **Coherent design system** – tokens for color/spacing/typography, reusable components (DataGrid, Form, Modal, Toast, Tabs).
* **Robust error UX** – inline validation, readable errors, “explain this error” and suggested fixes.
* **Internationalization** – i18n/l10n ready (RTL support, locale-aware formatting).
* **Predictable state** – minimal global state, cache-friendly queries, cancelable mutations, undo for bulk edits.

## Dashboards to ship early

* **Operations Overview** – pending approvals, blocked by validation, failures, missing assets/translations, avg time-to-publish (7d), “My queue.”
* **Data Quality** – completeness by channel/locale/category, rule leaderboard, drill-down to affected items.
* **Translation** – backlog by locale, SLA aging, quick assign and bulk accept.
* **Publish Health** – per-channel success rate, error taxonomy, recent failure feed with deep links.
* **Search & Saved Views** – adoption/usage metrics for filters and views (to inform UX).
* **Custom dashboards** – lightweight widgets for team-specific KPIs.

## Non-functional qualities

* **Reliability & integrity** – transactional writes where needed; conflict/merge handling; idempotent jobs.
* **Security & privacy** – least-privilege, audited access, PII handling where applicable.
* **Performance** – sub-100ms perceived latency for common actions; stream/virtualize large sets.
* **Compatibility** – API-first, schema-versioned contracts; stable adapters for channels.
* **Observability** – structured logs, metrics, traces; user-level breadcrumbs for support.

## Success metrics

* Time-to-publish ↓, failure rate ↓, time-to-fix ↓.
* Data completeness ↑ and rule conformance ↑ by channel/locale.
* Translator throughput ↑ with quality maintained.
* User productivity ↑ (bulk actions, shortcut usage, saved view reuse).
* Integration stability ↑ (fewer retries, fewer support tickets).

## Out of scope (for now)

* Heavy digital asset management.
* Full order/inventory management.
* Rich CMS/web rendering.
* Complex pricing/promotions engines.

## Channel Mapping UI

- **Visual mapping** of PIM attributes to each channel payload.
- **Field transformers** for attribute transformation.
- **Dry-run preview** of JSON payload before export.
- **Integration with Data Quality dashboard** for enhanced metrics visualization.
