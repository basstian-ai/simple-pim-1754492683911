# 🌟 Vision: Recipe Finder

This project is a **Recipe Finder web app** built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel.  
The goal is to create a small, polished app where users can explore, search, and save recipes — simple enough to build fast, but engaging enough to feel like a real product.

## Core Idea

A minimal recipe app that:
- 🍳 Lets users **search for recipes** from a public API.  
- 📖 Shows recipe details like ingredients, instructions, and images.  
- ❤️ Allows users to **save favorites** in local storage.  
- ⚡ Loads quickly and works well on mobile and desktop.  

## Scope

### ✅ MVP (v1.0)
- **Homepage** with search input and trending/popular recipes.  
- **Recipe detail page** with ingredients and steps.  
- **Favorites page** storing recipes locally.  
- **About page** describing the project.  

### 🚀 Future Ideas
- Search filtering (by category, cuisine, diet type).  
- Shareable recipe links.  
- Dark mode toggle.  
- Offline access to saved recipes.  

## Why This Matters

Cooking is universal — everyone relates to recipes.  
This app is designed to be:
- 🧑‍🍳 Useful: quick inspiration for meals, accessible anywhere.  
- 💻 Educational: demonstrates fetching data from an API, using dynamic routes, managing client-side state, and deploying seamlessly on Vercel.  
- 🎨 Delightful: a clean, simple UI that feels like a real product.  

## Data Source

**TheMealDB** — [https://www.themealdb.com](https://www.themealdb.com)  
- Search meals by name, ingredient, or category.  
- Get full details (ingredients, instructions, images, even YouTube cooking videos).  
- No authentication required for free tier.  

**Example Request:**
