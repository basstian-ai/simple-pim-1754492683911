# Minimal Python example (for CI/dev workflow)

This repository addition provides a tiny Python module and unit tests so you can
validate the test/run pipeline quickly.

Quickstart
----------
1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install pytest if you don't have it:

   pip install -U pytest

3. Run the tests:

   pytest

What you should see: two passing tests for the `hello.greet` function.
