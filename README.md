# Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a small Next.js web app that helps users discover recipes from TheMealDB, view full recipe details (ingredients, steps, images), and save favorites locally. The project is designed as a focused, deployable demo that demonstrates API fetching, dynamic routes, and client-side persistence.
