# Recipe Finder

A small, polished Recipe Finder web app built with Next.js. The app helps users search recipes (from TheMealDB), view details (ingredients, instructions, images), and save favorites locally.

Why this project exists
- Useful: quick inspiration for meals on any device.
- Educational: demonstrates fetching from an API, dynamic routes, client-side state, and a simple deployable app.

Core features (MVP)
- Homepage with search input and trending/popular recipes
- Recipe detail page (ingredients, steps, images, optional YouTube video)
- Favorites page (stored in localStorage)
- About page describing the project
