# Accessibility audit & remediation checklist (Admin UI)

Goal

- Run an accessibility (a11y) audit for key admin pages (products, attribute-groups, bulk-tags, dashboard), fix issues found (ARIA, keyboard focus, color contrast), and add automated accessibility checks to CI.

Scope

- Pages: Products, Attribute Groups, Bulk Tagging, Admin Dashboard widgets.
- Deliverables: checklist + remediation guidance, at least one automated test targeting admin UI patterns, CI job that runs the a11y tests on push/PR.

Checklist

1. Automated checks
   - [ ] Add jest-axe / axe checks for component-level and page-level smoke tests.
   - [ ] Run a11y checks in CI on push and PR.

2. Keyboard & focus
   - [ ] All interactive controls keyboard-focusable (tab order, logical grouping).
   - [ ] Focus visible styles for focusable elements.
   - [ ] Modal dialogs trap focus and return it to the opener on close.

3. ARIA & semantics
   - [ ] Use semantic HTML elements (button, label, nav, main, table, etc.) first.
   - [ ] When ARIA is needed, use correct roles and relationships (aria-labelledby, aria-describedby).
   - [ ] Ensure table headers use <th> and scope when appropriate.

4. Color & contrast
   - [ ] Text and interactive controls meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

5. Forms & labels
   - [ ] Inputs have associated <label> or aria-label/aria-labelledby.
   - [ ] Error messages are announced to screen readers (aria-live, aria-describedby linking).

6. Announcements & live regions
   - [ ] Important notifications are exposed via polite/assertive ARIA live regions when appropriate.

7. Images & icons
   - [ ] Decorative images have empty alt (alt=""). Informative images include descriptive alt text.

8. Testing & QA
   - [ ] Manual test steps documented.
   - [ ] Include keyboard-only walkthroughs, NVDA/VoiceOver spot-checks.

Remediation guidance (quick fixes)

- Missing labels: prefer visible <label for="...">. Use aria-label/aria-labelledby only when there is no visual label.
- Focus styles missing: add :focus-visible CSS rules to preserve visible focus for keyboard users.
- Modal/dialog: use role="dialog" with aria-modal="true", manage focus focus-trap, and restore focus on close.
- Tables: ensure <th> cells and scope attributes to link headers to data cells.

CI integration notes

- We add a lightweight Jest-based smoke test that runs jest-axe (axe-core) against representative admin UI markup.
- The CI job installs dev dependencies and runs the a11y test suite on push and pull requests.

Next steps

1. Run the new a11y test(s) in CI, see failures.
2. Triage failures and fix components incrementally. Prefer small PRs that fix a single class of issues (labels, focus, color contrast).
3. Add additional page-level tests that render the real page markup (or puppeteer/playwright checks against a running instance) as we make incremental fixes.
