# Product Information Management (PIM) — Vision

_Last updated: 2025-08-13 • Owner: TODO_[product_owner]_

## 1) Why we’re building this

We need a single, reliable source of product truth that shortens time-to-market, improves findability and conversion, and reduces manual work across channels. Today, product data is fragmented across ERP, spreadsheets, and merchant workflows, causing slow launches, inconsistent content, and costly rework.

**North Star:** Publish complete, localized, and channel-ready product data to every storefront and partner within **hours, not weeks**, with measurable quality and governance.

## 2) Who it serves (primary personas)

- **Merchandiser / Category Manager** – curates assortment, defines taxonomy, ensures completeness.
- **Content Editor** – enriches titles, bullets, long copy, images, and video.
- **Local Market Owner** – manages translations, market-specific rules, legal content.
- **E-commerce Manager** – requests attributes needed for PDP/PLP, bundles, cross-sell.
- **Integration Engineer** – ensures data flows reliably between ERP, PIM, DAM, OMS, search, and e-com.

## 3) Scope (what PIM is for)

**Authoritative for:** product structure, attributes, taxonomy, relationships, digital assets linkage, localization, channel mapping, data quality, workflows/audit, versioning.

**Integrates with (not authoritative for):**
- **ERP** (SKU, master ID, stock, prices where ERP is source)
- **DAM/CDN** (binary assets; PIM stores references/transform rules)
- **E-commerce engine** (publishing, search index, storefronts)
- **OMS/Logistics** (availability rules)
- **Translation** (TMS/LLM)
- **Search/Personalization** (feeds, attribute flags)

**Non-goals:** payment, fulfilment, PLM, CAD authoring, complex image editing, long-term media storage.

## 4) Core capabilities (MVP → Beyond)

1. **Ingestion & Modeling**
   - Import from ERP/spreadsheets/CSV/JSON (scheduled + on-demand)
   - Flexible schema: product → variant → attributes (typed), categories, bundles/kits
   - Attribute sets per family; channel & locale overrides
2. **Enrichment**
   - Required/completeness rules per channel/locale
   - Rich text + media linking (images/video/360°)
   - Variant handling (size/color/pack)
3. **Localization**
   - Language fallbacks; market-specific content and legal texts
   - TMS/LLM assisted translations with human review
4. **Data Quality & Governance**
   - Completeness score, validation rules, duplicate detection
   - Roles/permissions, audit trail, version history, approvals
5. **Publishing**
   - Channel mappings (e-com, marketplace, print, wholesale)
   - Incremental exports + webhooks; dry-run previews
6. **Automation (post-MVP)**
   - AI suggestions for titles/bullets, attribute inference
   - Auto-image selection rules, taxonomy suggestions

## 5) Architecture (high level)

- **Core PIM service** (API-first, headless)  
- **Storage**: product graph + document store for attributes; object references for assets  
- **Pipelines**: connectors for ERP/DAM/TMS; publishing adapters (e-com, search)  
- **Access**: REST/GraphQL read APIs; admin UI for authoring; webhooks for change events  
- **Envs**: dev, test, stage, prod; immutable builds; seed data fixtures

> Implementation should remain **composable** (replaceable connectors) and **deterministic** (idempotent imports & publishes).

## 6) Data model (essentials)

- **Product** `{id, family, attributes{}, categories[], assets[], relations[]}`
- **Variant** `{sku, attributes{}, assets[]}`
- **Relations**: accessories, replacements, bundles/kits
- **Scoping**: `channel` and `locale` overrides on attributes
- **Metadata**: `createdBy, updatedBy, version, approvals[]`

## 7) Content & workflow lifecycle

1. **Ingest** (from ERP/CSV) → **Draft** product
2. **Enrich** (attributes, media, translations) until **Completeness ≥ threshold**
3. **Review/Approve** (role-based)
4. **Publish** (per channel) with **incremental delta** exports
5. **Monitor** (quality, errors, SLAs) and **iterate**

## 8) Success metrics (KPIs)

- **Time-to-publish** new SKU: _≤ 24h_ from ERP ingest to live in primary channel
- **Completeness** at publish: _≥ 95%_ required fields per channel/locale
- **Error rate** in publish jobs: _< 1%_ failed items per run
- **Rework** (post-publish edits within 7 days): _-50%_ vs baseline
- **PDP conversion lift** on enriched categories: _+X%_ (set baseline once live)

## 9) Quality, performance & SLAs

- **Read API**: p95 < **200 ms** for product detail; p95 < **400 ms** for list (paginated)
- **Bulk import**: ≥ **1k SKUs/min** sustained; idempotent retries
- **Publish latency** (delta): < **5 min** to e-com/search after approval
- **Availability**: **99.9%** quarterly; queued retries w/ backoff
- **Observability**: structured logs, metrics (imports, publishes, DQ), alerts on failures

## 10) Security & compliance

- RBAC with least privilege; audit for all schema & content changes
- PII avoidance (product content only); GDPR-aligned processing
- Secrets in managed vault; signed webhooks; API tokens per integration

## 11) Risks & mitigations

- **Schema creep** → enforce attribute families + RFC process for new fields
- **Workflow bottlenecks** → configurable SLAs and queue visibility dashboards
- **Integration fragility** → contract tests + sandbox environments + replayable events
- **Content sprawl** → required fields per channel; enforcement in UI & CI

## 12) Phased delivery

**MVP (Month 0-2)**
- Minimal schema (top 3 families), ERP import, basic UI, completeness rules, single channel publish, manual translations
- KPIs: first category live end-to-end

**Phase 2 (Month 3-4)**
- Localization flows, approvals, audit trail, search feed, delta publishes, DQ dashboards

**Phase 3 (Month 5-6)**
- Marketplace feeds, bundles/kits, AI-assisted enrichment, advanced validations, print/wholesale exports

## 13) Operating model

- Changes via lightweight **RFCs** (`/roadmap/rfcs/`) for schema/workflow
- Weekly release; feature flags for risky changes
- Runbooks for import/publish incidents; RTO < 2h

## 14) How the AI Dev Agent uses this file

- Provides context for **task synthesis** and **implementation decisions**
- Defines non-goals to prevent scope creep
- Anchors prioritization: tasks that measurably improve KPIs or unblock publish pipelines rank higher

### Open Questions / TODOs
- TODO: Confirm authoritative system for **price** and **inventory** (likely ERP/OMS)
- TODO: Finalize completeness thresholds per channel/locale
- TODO: List target channels (e-com, search, marketplaces) and their adapters
- TODO: Choose translation path (TMS vendor vs LLM + human review)
- TODO: Name primary product families and attribute sets
