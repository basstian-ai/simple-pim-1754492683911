# 🌟 Vision: Recipe Finder

This project is a Recipe Finder web app built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel.
The goal is to create a small, polished app where users can explore, search, and save recipes — simple enough to build fast, but engaging enough to feel like a real product.

## Core Idea

### A minimal recipe app that:

🍳 Lets users search for recipes from a public API.

📖 Shows recipe details like ingredients, instructions, and images.

❤️ Allows users to save favorites in local storage.

⚡ Loads quickly and works well on mobile and desktop.

### Example Scope

For version 1.0, the app will include:
- Homepage with search input and trending/popular recipes.
- Recipe detail page with ingredients and steps.
- Favorites page storing recipes locally.
- About page describing the project.

## Why this matters

Cooking is universal — everyone relates to recipes. This app demonstrates how to:
Fetch and display data from a public API.
Use dynamic routes in Next.js.
Manage simple client-side state.
Deploy a clean, usable app quickly on Vercel.
⚡ In short: a small, beautiful app that makes finding recipes quick and fun.
