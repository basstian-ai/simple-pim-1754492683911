# Roadmap: Tasks

## Performance Audits

- TSK-20250815-001 â€” Conduct Performance Audit for Dashboard Widgets
  - Type: improvement
  - Priority: 4
  - Created: 2025-08-15T08:10:00Z
  - Description: Evaluate dashboard widget rendering and data-fetch patterns to identify bottlenecks and recommend optimizations (caching, virtualization, batching) to meet sub-100ms perceived latency goals.
  - Outputs:
    - reproducible microbenchmarks for representative widgets
    - measured baselines (fetch + render) with percentiles
    - checklist of actionable optimizations (caching, virtualization, batching, memoization, network strategies)
    - short PRs that apply low-risk, high-impact optimizations

Notes:
- Add audit artifacts and findings under `audits/performance-dashboard-widgets/`.
- Do not edit `vision.md` directly; append tasks here or in `roadmap/new.md`.
