    desc: >

      causes: inefficient joins, missing indexes or unbounded scansâ€”optimize queries, add pagination, and improve
      monitoring.

      Long-running query was terminated after surpassing the 5-minute execution cap, causing runtime errors and

      work, and capture EXPLAIN on timeout for diagnostics.
