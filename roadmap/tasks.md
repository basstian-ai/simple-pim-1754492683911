- type: feature
- title: Conduct Usability Testing for Dashboard Widgets
- desc: Organize a session to gather user feedback on the usability of dashboard widgets and identify areas for improvement.
- source: user
- created: 2025-08-15T03:00:00Z
- priority: 3
- status: proposed

### Goal
Validate that the Dashboard Widgets (Operations Overview, Data Quality heatmap, Translation backlog, Publish Health) are discoverable, interpretable, and actionable by primary users (merchandisers, channel managers, translators).

### Success criteria
- At least 8 sessions with representative users across roles (merchandiser, translator, channel manager).
- Quantitative: average System Usability Scale (SUS) score >= 75 for the dashboard flow, or clear root causes for scores < 75.
- Qualitative: 80% of participants can complete 4 core tasks without assistance; identify top 5 usability issues with reproducible steps.
- Concrete recommendations (design + product + analytics) and a roadmap of prioritized fixes.

### Deliverables
- Session recordings & notes (redacted where needed)
- Consolidated report (findings, severity, recommended fixes, owners, timeline)
- Updated dashboard task tickets with clear acceptance criteria

### How to run
1. Read the detailed plan in `roadmap/usability-testing.md`.
2. Use templates in `templates/` for session scripts and the report.
3. Create an internal issue to schedule sessions using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/usability-session-request.md`.
