- Pruned `/roadmap` to keep only `new.md`, `tasks.md`, `done.md`, and `bugs.md`; removed transient `.state` and `.lock` files.
- Scoped `/audits` with a nested `.gitignore` so only docs stay versioned.
- Canonical vision now at root `vision.md`; removed `roadmap/vision.md`.
- Consolidated tests under `/tests`; removed legacy `/__tests__` and `/test` directories.
