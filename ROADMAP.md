# ROADMAP

This file captures a short roadmap for the Recipe Finder app. It is intentionally small and focused so the project can ship an MVP quickly.

## Milestones

- v0.1 — Prototype
  - Basic Next.js app skeleton
  - Search input that queries TheMealDB
  - Display search results with images and short descriptions

- v1.0 — MVP
  - Homepage with search and trending recipes
  - Recipe detail page (ingredients, instructions, image, optional video)
  - Favorites page (persisted to localStorage)
  - About page and basic SEO/meta
  - Deployed to Vercel
    

- v1.x — Polish
  - Responsive UI improvements
  - Accessible components and keyboard support
  - Minor performance optimizations

## Future / Nice-to-have

- Advanced search filters (category, cuisine, diet)
- Shareable recipe links and deep linking
- Dark mode with user preference persisted
- Offline access for saved recipes (service worker / caching)
- User accounts and sync (stretch goal)

## Notes


Keep the scope small and deliver value visibly: prioritize features users interact with (search, view, save).
