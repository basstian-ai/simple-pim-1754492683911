Intro (read to participant)

"Thank you for joining. We're testing an early version of dashboard widgets that help teams monitor product readiness, data quality, translations, and publish health. There are no right or wrong answers — we want your honest reactions. We'll record the session for note-taking and analysis; recordings will be stored securely. Do you consent to being recorded?"

Warm-up questions

- Briefly describe your role and how you currently check product readiness or data issues.
- What tools do you use today for these tasks?

Core tasks

1) Discoverability
- Scenario: "You need to find items that are pending approval and blocking publish. Show how you would find that information."
- Probe: "What are you looking for? Which widget or menu would you expect this in?"

2) Interpretation (Data Quality heatmap)
- Scenario: "You're looking at the Data Quality heatmap for the 'Footwear' category in the UK locale. Explain what you see and what it implies about work to be done."
- Probe: "Which cells would you investigate first and why?"

3) Drill-down & action (Publish Health)
- Scenario: "Open the most recent publish failure for the 'Amazon-UK' channel. What do you look at? What would you try next to resolve it?"
- Probe: "Would you need any additional context? Where would you find it?"

4) Efficiency & saved views
- Scenario: "Create and save a view that filters products missing French translations and make it accessible to your team."
- Probe: "How would you name and share this view?"
